# my dots

would not recommend using other people's dotfiles, but if you wanna use mine feel free. run 'chmod +x setup; ./setup' in the Personal dir and you're good to go.

fun commands i made include:
    - wpm (terminal typing speed game)
    - push, tag, clone (git shortcuts)
    - a bunch of .bashrc aliases for easy dev (v for vim, l for ls -al, etc.)
    - idk, just look through it if you want
